# youtube-mp3

<h1>About</h1>
<p>Since <a href="http://youtube-mp3.org ">http://youtube-mp3.org </a>has shutdown, I started searching for an alternative, since every website I found had tons of ads and limits and many more crap, I decided to make my own program. It is based on the youtube-dl library made by rg3 (<a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/">https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A GUI for downloading youtube music and transforming them to MP3.</p>
<p>Written in VB.net.</p>
<p>DO not use this program for pirate use.</p>
